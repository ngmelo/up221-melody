    "    \n",
    "-- and then to identify the frequency of word pairs that are within 100 or less words of each other in each municipality/plan. This would need to be done with a cleaned wordlist instead of the raw text, which might produce approximate word count distances for unique word pairs that exclude a lot of (filler) words, but would ultimately be more meaningful than distance measured by spaces in the raw text.\n",

## About Me
Hi all, 

I was born and raised in San Bernardino County, though I've now lived, worked, and gone to school in the Inland Empire, the Bay Area, and Los Angeles (stayed in
California all my life). I like getting to know where I live/am by walking around -- I actually never know how to navigate a place until I've had a chance to explore places foot-to-ground. (Ironically, given that this class is about mapping, maps are not the most effective way for me to figure out where I am or where I'm going.) 

## My Interests
I'm interested in food systems, food justice and sovereignty, land security, environmental justice, community self-determination, power, and how all those things
relate to and impact each other.

## My Objectives for UP221
(Vaguely and broadly) I'd like to figure out how to use maps to identify the equity of access to things -- like benefits, risks, burdens -- and outcomes. I'm interested in figuring out (1) how to map frequencies and distributions of things that people are experiencing and, eventually, (2) how to integrate ethnography into mapping so that I can facilitate mapping projects that allow communities to tell nuanced stories using both qualitative and quantitative data about their history (what has happened to them) and their desired futures (what they want).

## Potential Project Ideas
1. I'd like to map soil quality on vacant lands and lands that are made available by policies like the LA Urban Agriculture Incentive Zone and cross reference those locations with historical land use projects and policies that have potentially impacted land quality
2. I'd like to map existing community gardens and urban farms in cities, soil quality on or near lands where those gardens and farms are sited, median household income, and race/ethnicity distribution (by census tract or zip?)
